# -Precision-irrigation-RL
Developed two deep reinforcement learning frameworks: one for precision irrigation optimization and another
for enhancing spoilage tracking systems using a novel hybrid deep learning architecture for Q-value
prediction. Additionally, I designed custom environments for both projects, integrating real-time sensor data
from IoT setups to ensure accurate and dynamic learning
